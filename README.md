How each cube was made (Top-left to bottom-right):
- Basic material with orange color, transparent = true and wireframe = true. Inspired by one of the example spheres: https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials
- Extra shader added by me. This one uses rainbowShader.frag, which assigns fragment color based its position, creating a rainbow effect.
- Built using the part 1 instructions. Uses Phong material and specularity.
- Built using the part 2 instructions. Uses vertexShader.vert and fragmentShader.frag, assigning the two uniform vec3 colors to pink and purple.
- Normal material with no assigned values. Also inspired by an example sphere: https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials
