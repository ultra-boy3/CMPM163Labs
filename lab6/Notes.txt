Video 1:
Types of Lighting: Realtime, baked, mixed
- Continuous baking: determines if lighting changes update on the fly or
only on-demand
- Light bounce: how much light is reflected by surfaces
- Probes: Used to sample light or reflection

Main properties: Ambient light, reflection, and light sources

Video 2:
Light component:
- Point light: like a light bulb, shines equally in all directions
- Directional light: Affects all objects in the scene based on its
roation, similar to the sun. Position is irrelevant.
- Sopt light: Shines light on objects within a cone. Position and
rotation matter.
- Area light: Only works with baked lighting. Shines light on all objects
on one side of a rectangular plane.

Other Lights:
- Ambient light
- Emissive materials (baked lighting only)

Video 3 & 4:
- Two standard shaders
	- Metallic
		- Metalness can be defined by slider or texture. Texture can give
		  varying metalness
	- Specular
- Rendering modes:
	- Transparent, based on color alpha. Retains reflection.

Video 5: Textures
- Applied to materials, can be any supported image file
- Supports transparent textures (except jpg)
- Set texture type presets (texture, normal map, etc)
- Various quality settings
