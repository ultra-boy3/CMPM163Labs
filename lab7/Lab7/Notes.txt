Connecting position to Voronoi allows it to use the position for its noise
generation.

Different nodes connect and combine to create custom effects

Object Space vs. World Space
- Distortion can be based on local position or world position. World position
	causes the distortion to change based on position in the scene view.

We can also use slides to adjust the strength of effects. (In real production this
would be done through code)
