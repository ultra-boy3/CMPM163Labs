Connecting position to Voronoi allows it to use the position for its noise
generation.

Different nodes connect and combine to create custom effects

Object Space vs. World Space
- Distortion can be based on local position or world position. World position
	causes the distortion to change based on position in the scene view.

We can also use slides to adjust the strength of effects. (In real production this
would be done through code)

Additional Features:
- Snow on mountains based on y-position (Used split, blend, 
and color nodes)
- Snowy particle system, particles affected by gravity
- Space skybox (free asset)
- Camera with Occlusion culling and anti-aliasing enabled
- Post-process volume with bloom & depth of field enabled

Partner Responses (Alex Barclay):
1. I did part 1
2.. I found translating what I learned deforming the sphere mesh
to making mountains with a plane the most difficult.  The most
difficult part that was in a tutorial was getting the shader
code syntax right on the wave tutorial.
3. The most interesting part of the tutorials was getting the 
waves to go along two axes of the plane.

Alex and I did not help eachother on this lab.
